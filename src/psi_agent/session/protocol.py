"""Default ceiling on agent-loop rounds per turn.

Raised from 40 to 60 on 2026-09-10, after measuring what actually hits the
ceiling in ToB production (443 history files, 64 hits across 10 sessions).  The
hits split into two shapes with opposite remedies, and only one of them is what
this number governs:

- **Real work that ran long** (the three human sessions read line by line):
  23-25 distinct calls per turn with *zero* repeats — build a client deck (find
  logo, read the generator, extract links, resolve the domain, fall back to the
  Wayback archive), or clone a repo and read eight files before editing five.
  These turns were doing useful work and got cut off mid-way, so a higher
  ceiling converts a truncated answer into a finished one.
- **A convergence bug** (``scheduler-cedce38a1e5fcfab``): 22 calls to
  ``feishu_attendance_query`` with byte-identical arguments returning
  byte-identical ``ok: true`` payloads.  The tool never failed and the data was
  never empty; the model simply would not accept the result.  Raising the
  ceiling makes this shape *worse*, which is the cost this bump knowingly pays
  — the fix belongs in the SOP prompt, not here.

Tool discovery is not what fills these turns: the three meta tools are 3.1% of
all calls (826 of 26607) and none of them reach the top 15 in the turns that
hit the ceiling.  So the M2 exposure gate is not implicated either way.

Raised from 20 to 40 on 2026-09-05.  20 replaced 128 after real-traffic
measurements (rounds per turn p50=3, p90=13, observed max=49): 128 sat so far
above the distribution that a runaway burned 128 model calls before stopping —
in practice there was no ceiling at all — while 20 sat above p90 and capped a
runaway at roughly a sixth of the old cost.

Both workspace tool surfaces have since grown past the traffic that number was
measured against (ToC desktop ≈90 and ToB feishu ≈190 exposed tools, with
tool-discovery chains, browser_* interaction tools and multi-step SOP skills),
and normal turns began reaching 20 in routine use.  A 1000-turn local sample
over the same span measured p50=0, p90=5, p95=10, p99=32, tail up to the old
128 cap — 1.9% of turns exceeded 20 rounds.

40 covers that measured non-runaway tail (≈3x the production p90 of 13 and
above the local p99 of 32) while remaining a real ceiling: a runaway now burns
about a third of the old 128-round cost, and the observed runaway shapes
(bash x128, a 49-round turn holding the turn lock) are still stopped well
short of where they used to land.

60 keeps that property — under half the old 128 cap — while clearing the
longest *legitimate* turns measured above, which ran into 40 while still
producing new calls every round.  It is deliberately not raised further: the
ceiling has to stay low enough that the repeat-the-same-call shape is stopped
before it burns a turn's worth of upstream calls unattended, since schedules
hit it with nobody watching.

Hitting the limit therefore stays a visible, occasional event rather than
"never": the stop is reported explicitly to the user (``MAX_ROUNDS_NOTICE``)
instead of just to the log.  Callers that legitimately need more rounds should
pass ``max_tool_rounds`` explicitly (flows already do).

Single source of truth for all three entry points (``Session``,
``SessionAgent.__init__``, ``SessionAgent.create``) — they drifted as separate
literals before, so changing "the default" meant finding every copy.

"""User-facing text appended when the round limit stops a turn.

Written for the person in the chat, not for a log reader: the bare
``[Max tool rounds reached]`` this replaces was an untranslated developer token
that arrived glued to whatever interstitial narration the model had produced
("让我再查一下。[Max tool rounds reached]"), so a Feishu user saw a half-finished
reply with a bracketed English string and no way to tell a round-limit stop from
a crash.  It states what happened, why, and what to do next, and carries the
round count so the log line and the chat agree on the same number.

Leading blank line separates it from the model's own last words; the bracketed
prefix stays so operators grepping histories keep a stable marker.

    that wants to say "reading a doc" needs only the name.
