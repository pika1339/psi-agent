    filesystem can read ``path`` directly. It is filled (by ``ChannelCore``) only
    for output files coming from a Session reached over TCP — i.e. one living in
    another container, whose ``path`` is meaningless here. Without it a client
    cannot tell "the file is missing" from "the file is somewhere else", and the
    latter used to surface as an unconsumed ``[SEND:]`` marker sent as plain text.

    Defaulted so every input-side construction site stays unchanged: only the

class ReasoningChunk:
    """A streamed reasoning/thinking fragment. Output only — never sent as input.

    ``kind`` is optional provenance inside the compressed ``reasoning`` wire
    slot (``thinking`` / ``tool_call`` / ``tool_result``). Missing kind keeps
    legacy behaviour (CLI dim-prints everything).

    ``tool_name`` is the bare tool name for ``tool_call`` / ``tool_result``
    kinds, carried **beside** ``text`` rather than parsed out of it. ``text`` is
    ``[Tool Call: name({...})]`` with user arguments interpolated, so a regex
    over it has to survive nested brackets and quotes inside those arguments —
    and the one consumer that needs the name (the Feishu status line) uses it as
    a whitelist key, where a mis-parse silently degrades to the generic
    fallback. ``None`` for every other kind, and for streams produced before
    this field existed.

    ``tool_args`` is the JSON-dumped arguments of a ``tool_call``, carried the
    same way and for a stronger version of the same reason: the Feishu live
    process block *displays* them, and the regex that used to recover them from
    ``text`` ended at the first ``)]`` — an argument containing those two
    characters literally (measured: ``{"command": "echo )]"}``) was shown
    truncated to ``{"command": "echo``. ``None`` for ``tool_result`` and every
    other kind.
